<h1> The SelaCoin WhitePaper</h1> 


<h2>what is SelaCoin ?</h2>
SelaCoin (SELA) is a cryptocurrency as well as a blockchain focused on privacy and speed of the entire network.


<h2>The problems in current blockchains: </h2>
<h3>A - Minimum Conformations</h3>
all current blockchains are slow compared to digital assets like banks or similar solutions.

All current blockchains have a minimum transaction time till any given transaction is permanently written into the blockchain.

One problem is that a high number of conformations greatly increases the need to mine faster, just to confirm a given transaction.

This means that coins like bitcoin with increasing difficulty will become slower to confirm the harder it becomes to mine, resulting in an even slower time to send someone some of your coins.

The second aspect of this is of course environmental - the ever growing need to confirm transactions on an increasingly harder to mine blockchain means having to use stronger more power hungry servers just to keep the network running.

SelaCoin addresses this by lowering the min conformation time to 2 conformations - and obviously empowering pos as well as pow to allow virtually anyone to mine or stake SelaCoins without the need for entire servers just to mine.

<h3>B - Transaction Amount Per minute limits based on tx size</h3>

imagine an enormous excel sheet - with each cell having a maximum size of several kb - then imagine having to copy paste those cells to another excel - each such transaction will “feed” on ram memory and the larger the size of information each such transaction carries the harder it will be to send it fast and secure.

A second problem that arises regarding this issue is that on slower internet connections there can occur a kind of lag that will cause a transaction to fail - you can see alot of those on the ethereum blockchain and similar that simply fail due to the size they need to transmit to the blockchain.

SelaCoin Addresses that by keeping things simple and small in terms of tx size - since cryptocurrency is just that - a crypto currency - and as such should be both easy on the network side as well as on the space and cpu side. 

<h3>C - The price to generate new transactions </h3>

Alot of cryptocurrencies both old and new use a price per action on the blockchain.

the main problem arises when that price is directly tiied to the current block height - meaning the older that currency is and harder to mine the more expensive it will be to send anyone some coins.

The second largest issue with this is that only early adopters of that blockchain will actually benefit as late comers will need to pay alot just to use that blockchain.

And how can we forget the famous 143 ether to do a single transaction that occurred a while back - when a user was billed a ridiculous amount just because he passed the wrong gas price.

SelaCoin solves this easily by capping the maximum amount that will ever need to be paid to write a transaction to the blockchain.

<h3>D - Anonymity and security </h3>

alot of coins have quite alot of security issues - for example the ability to guess the seeed words and hack accounts or just wallets that enforce us to over secure our own digital assstes causing us to forget passwords and loose funds.

SellaCoin Solves this easily by giving the users the choice of how they want to secure their wallets.

SelaCoin will never enforce users to use a specific type of password or do any other thing that they don't want to.

As we see it - digital currency should be easy and fast to use and not the way it is today - that it is harder to login to your wallet then it is to login to your online bank account.


SelaCoin Is a project built after many years of looking at the problems that arose in other crypto projects. It is Maintained by pablo rotem, shadi baksheet and wisam saleh.
